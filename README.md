## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation is initiated from the Appilot dashboard, where users define target Quora topics, followed questions, or user profiles.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot controls the Android device or emulator using UI Automator, identifying new answers through UI parsing or internal activity detection.  
3. **Output or Action** — Sends push or webhook notifications to the user’s defined endpoint upon detecting new activity.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Retry mechanisms, logs, and error recovery ensure consistent alerting without manual supervision.
